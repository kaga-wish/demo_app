# Second rails application in the course 

Actually this is "demo_app", the second application in this course and its main aim is to show the ruby on rails
scaffolding. So its mainly a scaffolding presentation. Keeping in mind that scaffolding actually is a very bad way
to design a real world web application cause many of the generated code is not human friendly, at least for 
beginners, and it's usability is hard.
